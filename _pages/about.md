I am a Cybersecurity Student at the [Cyberschool](https://cyberschool.univ-rennes.fr/en) of the [University of Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes.fr/en), France. This Master's program is a deep dive into the field of Cybersecurity, covering courses on system, software, and network security, pentesting, reverse engineering, and cryptography. I was awarded a merit-based scholarship by the Cyberschool to pursue this Master's degree.

In 2022, I graduated from the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the [University of Paris-Est Cr√©teil](https://www.en.u-pec.fr/), France, with the Highest Honor. During my Bachelor's program, I completed a 5-month internship at [Viaccess-Orca](https://www.viaccess-orca.com/), where I worked on a homemade vulnerability scanner using Python and the ELK Stack.

Currently, I am working as a Research Intern in the [Spicy team](https://www-spicy.irisa.fr/) of [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/en) under the supervision of [Mohamed Sabt](https://people.irisa.fr/Mohamed.Sabt/). My research focuses on the Widevine DRM.
